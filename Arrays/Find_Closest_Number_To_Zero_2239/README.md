# Find Closest Number To Zero 2239
Solution:
- We start by dividing the array into two parts, one with the negative values and other with positive values.
- We keep seperate value and index variables for both and iterate over the array updating them depending on their condition.
- Lastly we compare both to see which of the numbers we should return if they are same we return the positive index else the one with the least absolute value.
